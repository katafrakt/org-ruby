** YAML header in Webby

   Make sure you don't have TABS here. Best practice: Configure your
   editor to use spaces instaed of tabs, and if you can see whitespace,
   even better.

   In emacs, set indent-tabs-mode to NIL.
** Ruby Gems behind Proxy

   Set the following environment variable:

   So, I added a User Variable for my account called http_proxy with
   the value of http://<proxyserveraddress>:8080, rebooted, ran plan
   old vanillia gem install rails â€“include-dependencies, and magically,
   it worked

** VDI deployment stats

Key takeaways:
-	74% are using VDI in production or pilot ... but 45% of those using have less than 100 users
-	Upward of 55% of the DAC members [project] they will have up to 50% of their users using VDI in 3 years (~1/2 of those will have > 50%)
-	No real surprises on the reasons / benefits etc
-	Interestingly ... even if TS supported all client apps / supported user-install apps - 100% of the DAC preferred VDI over TS
-	Most companies said a portion of their users would have VDI as the primary replacement desktop (60% < 20% of users, 32% 21-50% of users)
